#' Map infection-to-diagnosis delays to clinical detection probabilities
#'
#' Calculates the probability that an individual infected at a given lag
#' will be clinically diagnosed, conditional on the delay from infection to
#' diagnosis and the probabilities of being symptomatic, seeking healthcare,
#' and receiving a diagnosis.
#'
#' This is an internal helper function used by
#' [calculate_clinical_detection_prob()].
#'
#' @param lag Numeric vector of lags, in days, from infection to the
#'   potential day of diagnosis.
#' @param max_lag Maximum lag, in days, represented by `inf_to_diag`.
#' @param prob_symptomatic Probability that an infected individual
#'   develops symptoms.
#' @param prob_seek_healthcare Probability that a symptomatic
#'   individual seeks healthcare.
#' @param prob_diagnosis Probability that an individual seeking
#'   healthcare receives a diagnosis.
#' @param inf_to_diag Numeric vector giving the probability distribution of
#'   the delay from infection to diagnosis. The element at index `k + 1`
#'   corresponds to a delay of `k` days.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector containing the probability of clinical diagnosis
#'   for each value of `lag`. Values outside the range `0` to `max_lag` are
#'   assigned a probability of zero.

#' Calculate probability of clinical detection
#'
#' Calculates the probability of clinical detection over time based on
#' wastewater-derived infections and distributions describing delays from
#' infection to symptom onset, healthcare seeking, and diagnosis.
#'
#' The delay distributions are normalised before being convolved to obtain
#' the distribution of the total delay from infection to diagnosis. The
#' resulting probabilities are then used to calculate the probability of
#' observing at least one clinical detection for each day.
#'
#' @param nts Output of [generate_number_shedding_time_series()]
#' @param det Output of [calculate_wastewater_ttd()]
#' @param delay_onset Numeric vector giving the probability distribution of
#'   the delay from infection to symptom onset.
#' @param delay_seek Numeric vector giving the probability distribution of
#'   the delay from symptom onset to seeking healthcare.
#' @param delay_diag Numeric vector giving the probability distribution of
#'   the delay from seeking healthcare to diagnosis.
#' @param prob_symptomatic Numeric probability that an infected individual
#'   develops symptoms.
#' @param prob_seek_healthcare Probability that a symptomatic
#'   individual seeks healthcare.
#' @param prob_diagnosis Probability that an individual seeking
#'   healthcare is diagnosed.

#' @return The object supplied to `det$sampled_data`,
